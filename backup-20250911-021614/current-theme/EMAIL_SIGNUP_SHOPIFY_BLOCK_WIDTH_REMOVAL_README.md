# Email Signup Block - Shopify Block Width Removal
**Date:** September 9, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

Removed the `width: 100%` CSS rule for `.shopify-block` from the Email Signup block. This allows the `.shopify-block` element to use its natural width behavior instead of being forced to full width.

## ðŸ”§ Change Made

### **Before (Removed):**
```css
/* Ensure shopify-block takes full width */
.shopify-block {
  width: 100% !important;
}
```

### **After (Removed):**
- The CSS rule has been completely removed
- `.shopify-block` now uses its natural width behavior
- No forced width constraints on the shopify-block element

## ðŸŽ¯ Impact

### **What This Changes:**
- **Natural Width:** `.shopify-block` now uses its natural width behavior
- **Theme Compatibility:** Better compatibility with theme's default width handling
- **Flexibility:** Allows the theme to control `.shopify-block` width as intended
- **No Forced Constraints:** Removes the forced `width: 100% !important` rule

### **What This Doesn't Affect:**
- âœ… **Email Signup Block Width:** The custom width settings for the Email Signup block itself remain intact
- âœ… **Container Width:** The `.email-signup-block--custom-width` class still works
- âœ… **Responsive Behavior:** Mobile width behavior is unchanged
- âœ… **All Other Settings:** All other Email Signup block settings remain functional

## ðŸ”„ Email Signup Block Width Settings Still Available

### **Custom Width Controls:**
- **Width Setting:** "fill" (Wide 100%) or "custom" options
- **Custom Width:** 0-1000px range for desktop
- **Custom Width Mobile:** 0-1000px range for mobile
- **CSS Class:** `.email-signup-block--custom-width` still applies

### **Width Behavior:**
- **Fill (Wide 100%):** Email Signup block takes full available width
- **Custom:** Email Signup block uses specified pixel width
- **Mobile:** Always full width on mobile devices
- **Responsive:** Proper responsive behavior maintained

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Impact

### **Before Removal:**
- `.shopify-block` was forced to `width: 100% !important`
- This could interfere with theme's natural width handling
- Potential conflicts with theme's layout system

### **After Removal:**
- `.shopify-block` uses natural width behavior
- Better integration with theme's layout system
- More predictable width behavior
- Improved theme compatibility

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### **CSS Removed:**
```css
/* Ensure shopify-block takes full width */
.shopify-block {
  width: 100% !important;
}
```

### **Why This Was Removed:**
- **Theme Compatibility:** The forced width could interfere with theme's natural width handling
- **Layout Conflicts:** Could cause unexpected layout issues
- **Unnecessary Override:** The Email Signup block has its own width controls
- **Better Integration:** Allows theme to handle `.shopify-block` width naturally

### **What Remains:**
